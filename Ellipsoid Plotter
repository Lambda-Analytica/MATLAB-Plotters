%NAME: "EllipsoidPlotter.m"

%PURPOSE: This program generates a surface plot of an ellipsoid
%(or any other shape) using the ellipsoid equation.

%INPUT: The user begins by running the program. the user will then be
%prompted in the command window to enter the normalized values of the
%semi-axes beginning with the x-direction, then y, then z-direction. 
%Pressing enter after each entry will intitiate the next step.

%OUTPUT: Once the semi-axes have been input, the program generates a
%surface plot of the desired ellipsoid.



%-----------------------------COMPUTATION--------------------------------


% Get user input for semi-axes of the ellipsoid
a = input('Enter semi-axis length along x: ');
b = input('Enter semi-axis length along y: ');
c = input('Enter semi-axis length along z: ');

% Define the number of grid points and the ranges for theta and phi
n = 50;
theta = linspace(0, pi, n);
phi = linspace(0, 2*pi, n);

% Compute the grid values for x, y, and z
x = zeros(n,n);
y = zeros(n,n);
z = zeros(n,n);

%To plot an ellipsoid, we need to generate the surface based
%on the ellipsoid equation, which involves scaling the
%x, y, and z coordinates by the semi-axes of the ellipsoid.

        y(i,j) = b*sin(theta(i))*sin(phi(j));
        z(i,j) = c*cos(theta(i));
